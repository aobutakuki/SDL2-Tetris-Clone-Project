# Tetris clone project

This is the first of many projects on cloning old games, or making basic and simple games in order to enforce my knowledge on C++ and OOP concepts. I believe it is also a very interesting opportunity to learn the logic behind the games and to learn SDL2.


The project is not finished, but the SDL2.dll is in the repository, which it means that after setting up SDL2, you could run the program just by opening the .sln on VS Community.


This read me will be updated as time goes on.


## Notes (To-do)

- Make a grid-system for easier collision detection ðŸŸ¡
- Use git and create new branches so it is easier to experiment ðŸŸ¢
- Randomize the way that the shapes get produced
- Add a way to preview the next shape
- Allow player to move the shapes
- Add score
- Add a configuration system (later)
- Add different play modes (later)
